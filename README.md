## What I learned

I created this website to learn and actually experience using html.

I was able to understand the layout of a html structure. 

## Overview of tools used from html

* title

* img

* table (td (row), td (column))

* h1-h4 (text size)

* p (paragraph)

* b (bold), i (italics), em (emphasis)

* br (line break)

* hr (create horizontal line)

* ul (unordered list), li (list item)

* a href="#" (destination urls), button

* ol (ordered list)

* iframe (embedding a video)

* form (creates form for user input), input type="text"(same as button)

## Why talk about Halo 3
Well this is a personal project. 
I wanted to have fun still and work on a website that I could enjoy building.
